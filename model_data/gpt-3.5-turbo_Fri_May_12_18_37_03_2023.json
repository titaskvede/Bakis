The sugar molecule and the nitrogenous base form a nucleoside, and when a phosphate group is added, it becomes a nucleotide.\n\nNucleotides are connected together by phosphodiester bonds to build the linear chains of nucleic acids RNA and DNA. In DNA, nucleotides form an antiparallel double helix structure, and in RNA, nucleotides form a single-stranded linear molecule.\n\nNucleotides have several functions in cells, such as serving as building blocks for DNA and RNA, energy carriers like ATP (adenosine triphosphate), and signaling molecules within cells like cyclic AMP (cAMP)."}, "What is a codon?": {"time": 5.924316883087158, "answer": "A codon is a sequence of three nucleotides (triplet) in DNA or RNA that codes for a specific amino acid or serves as a start or stop signal of protein synthesis. Each of the 64 possible codons corresponds to one of the 20 amino acids used to build proteins or to one of the three nonsense or stop codons that indicate the end of protein synthesis.\n\nDuring protein synthesis, a ribosome reads the sequence of codons in an mRNA molecule and translates them into the corresponding sequence of amino acids to form a protein. The genetic code is the set of rules by which codons in DNA or RNA are translated into specific amino acids.\n\nSince there are 4 different nucleotides in DNA and RNA, and three nucleotides are used to form each codon, there are a total of 64 (4^3) possible codons, but only 20 different amino acids are encoded by the genetic code. As a result, some amino acids are coded by more than one codon, and such codons are called synonymous codons.
