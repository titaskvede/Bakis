It can be summarized in three main steps:\n1. DNA replication: The process by which the genetic information encoded in the DNA molecule is precisely copied into a new DNA molecule during cell division.\n2. Transcription: The process by which the genetic information in a DNA sequence is used to synthesize a complementary RNA molecule, called messenger RNA (mRNA).\n3. Translation: The process by which the mRNA molecule serves as a template for the synthesis of a protein, according to the genetic code.\n\nEssentially, the central dogma states that genetic information flows from DNA to RNA to protein, and that this flow of information is one-way and unidirectional, meaning that genetic information is not transferred back from protein to RNA or to DNA. This principle explains the mechanism by which genetic information is stored, transmitted, and expressed in all living organisms."}, "What is a genome?": {"time": 30.19120740890503, "answer": "RATE LIMIT: Rate limit reached for default-gpt-3.5-turbo in organization org-ewHIDGc2eR9Cbqjz5VT9WZqt on requests per min.

DNA is composed of nucleotides that contain a sugar called deoxyribose, while RNA is composed of nucleotides that contain a sugar called ribose. DNA is a double-stranded helix structure, while RNA is typically single-stranded.\n\nAnother key difference between DNA and RNA is their base composition. Both DNA and RNA contain four different nitrogenous bases: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and uracil (U) in RNA, which replaces thymine (T) in DNA. In DNA, A pairs with T, and C pairs with G, while in RNA, A pairs with U, and C pairs with G.\n\nDNA carries the genetic information that is passed down from one generation to the next, while RNA plays a variety of roles in gene expression, such as carrying the genetic information from DNA to the ribosomes, where protein synthesis occurs.\n\nFinally, DNA is present in the nucleus of the cells, while RNA is made both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm of the cell and also serves as a genetic material for some viruses."}, "What is a nucleotide?": {"time": 6.259934186935425, "answer": "A nucleotide is a basic building block of nucleic acids, including DNA and RNA.

The sequence of amino acids determines the three-dimensional structure of a protein, which in turn determines its function.\n\nFor example, some amino acids are hydrophobic and tend to be buried inside the protein, while others are hydrophilic and tend to be exposed on the protein surface and interact with water or other proteins. Some amino acids have a positive or negative charge and can form ionic bonds with other amino acids, while others can form disulfide bonds that stabilize the protein structure.\n\nOverall, the unique combination of amino acids in a protein determines its structure and function, and plays a critical role in biological processes.\n\nA BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) search is a computational method used to compare a given DNA or protein sequence to a large database of known sequences to infer functional and evolutionary relationships. It is a widely used bioinformatics tool that can identify similar sequences in different organisms, infer homology, and predict the function of unknown sequences.\n\nBLAST works by aligning the query sequence against a database of reference sequences and identifies local regions of similarity. The algorithm then calculates a statistical measure called an E-value that estimates how likely it is that the observed similarity between the query and the reference sequence is due to chance. A lower E-value typically indicates a higher degree of significance in the similarity score.\n\nBy comparing a query sequence to a database of known sequences, BLAST can provide insights into the function and evolutionary history of the query sequence, and can help researchers identify potential homologs or functional domains for further investigation."}, "What is a multiple sequence alignment?": {"time": 7.730160236358643, "answer": "Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is a computational process that involves the comparison of multiple DNA, RNA, or protein sequences to identify regions or motifs that are conserved or have functional significance.

The GO system includes a hierarchical vocabulary of terms and relationships that describe the biological processes and molecular functions of genes. These terms are used to annotate genes in many databases, such as the Gene Ontology Consortium and the UniProt Knowledgebase.\n\nThe GO system consists of three main categories: biological process, molecular function, and cellular component. The \"biological process\" category describes the broader biological context of a gene or protein, such as \"cellular respiration\" or \"developmental processes,\" while the \"molecular function\" category describes the specific biochemical activities of a protein, such as \"kinase activity\" or \"DNA binding.\" The \"cellular component\" category describes the subcellular structures or locations in which the gene product is active, such as \"mitochondrion\" or \"nucleus.\"\n\nOverall, the gene ontology system provides a standardized and comprehensive framework for describing the complex functions and properties of genes and their products. It allows researchers to compare and analyze data from different experiments and organisms and provides a foundation for predicting the functions of new genes or gene products based on their similarities to known genes and gene products.\n\nA protein domain is a structurally and functionally distinct region of a protein that can fold and function independently from the rest of the protein. Protein domains are the building blocks of proteins, and they play critical roles in protein function, evolution, and regulation.\n\nProteins are composed of one or more domains, and each domain is associated with a specific function or activity. For example, the kinase domain is a protein domain that is responsible for catalyzing the transfer of a phosphate group to other proteins or molecules, while the DNA-binding domain is a protein domain that interacts specifically with DNA to regulate transcription.\n\nProtein domains can be identified using bioinformatics tools such as BLAST, Pfam, and InterPro, which compare protein sequences across different organisms and identify regions of similarity or structural motifs.
