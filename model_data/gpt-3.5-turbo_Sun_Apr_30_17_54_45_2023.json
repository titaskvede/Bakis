The central dogma states that genetic information flows from DNA to RNA to proteins. In other words, the DNA sequence is transcribed into RNA, which is then translated into the amino acid sequence of proteins. \n\nThe process of translation occurs in ribosomes, where the genetic information contained in mRNA is used to synthesize proteins. Proteins, in turn, are the molecular machines that carry out most of the functions in a cell, including catalysis of reactions and structural support.\n\nThis principle is central to the understanding of the fundamental biological processes such as DNA replication, transcription, and translation, and is essential for the interpretation of many experiments in molecular biology."}, "What is a genome?": {"time": 4.466578722000122, "answer": "A genome is the complete genetic material present in one set of chromosomes of an organism. It includes all the DNA, both coding and non-coding, that makes up the organism's hereditary information. The genome provides the blueprint for the development, function, and maintenance of an organism throughout its life cycle, and contains information that controls traits such as eye color, height, susceptibility to disease, and many other characteristics.\n\nThe genome consists of long chains of nucleotides, which are the building blocks of DNA. Coding sequences within the genome are responsible for the production of proteins, which carry out most of the functions in a cell. Non-coding sequences within the genome can also have important regulatory functions, such as controlling gene expression and facilitating DNA replication and repair. \n\nGenome studies play an important role in the fields of medical and environmental research, as it helps in identifying genetic variations associated with certain diseases and studying the genetic diversity of organisms.

DNA sequencing is an essential tool in fields such as genetics, genomics, evolutionary biology, and personalized medicine.\n\nThe first method for DNA sequencing was developed by Frederick Sanger in the 1970s, which revolutionized the field of molecular biology. Since then, various technologies have been developed, providing faster and more accurate DNA sequencing methods. The most commonly used methods today are next-generation sequencing (NGS) and third-generation sequencing (TGS).\n\nNGS platforms, such as Illumina and Ion Torrent, can generate very large amounts of DNA sequence data quickly and inexpensively. They work by breaking DNA into small fragments, which are then amplified and sequenced simultaneously. TGS platforms, such as PacBio and Oxford Nanopore, provide long reads that can overcome the limitations of NGS, such as difficulty in assembling complex genomic regions with high repeat content.\n\nDNA sequencing has numerous applications, such as identifying genetic variations associated with diseases, designing personalized therapies, and studying the evolution of species.

However, they differ in some fundamental ways.\n\nDNA (Deoxyribonucleic acid) is double-stranded, while RNA (Ribonucleic acid) is usually single-stranded. DNA is found primarily in the nucleus of a cell, while RNA can be found both in the nucleus and the cytoplasm. DNA carries genetic information and is responsible for passing it to the offspring. RNA acts as a messenger that decodes DNA and helps to synthesize proteins.\n\nBoth DNA and RNA are made up of chains of nucleotides. A nucleotide is composed of three parts: a nitrogenous base, a sugar molecule, and a phosphate group. The nitrogenous base can be one of four types - adenine, guanine, cytosine, or thymine (only in DNA) in DNA, and uracil (replacing thymine) in RNA. The sugar molecule in DNA is called deoxyribose, while RNA has a sugar molecule called ribose. The phosphate group links the sugar molecules together, forming the backbone of the DNA or RNA molecule.\n\nThe order of the nitrogenous bases in the nucleotide sequence of a DNA or RNA molecule is what carries the genetic information in the form of the genetic code, which determines the sequence of amino acids in a protein."}, "What is a codon?": {"time": 4.789213180541992, "answer": "A codon is a sequence of three nucleotides (the building blocks of DNA and RNA) that code for a specific amino acid in a protein. The genetic code is a set of rules that specifies which codons code for which amino acids. There are 64 possible codon combinations, but only 20 amino acids are used to make proteins. Some amino acids are encoded by more than one codon, but each codon codes for only one amino acid.\n\nFor example, the codons AUG, UUG, CUG, and GUG all code for the amino acid methionine. The genetic code is universal, meaning that the same codons code for the same amino acids in all living organisms, with very few exceptions.\n\nDuring the process of translation, an RNA sequence is decoded by a ribosome, which reads each codon and recruits the corresponding amino acid to build a protein. The order of the codons determines the sequence of amino acids in the protein and ultimately its function. Any mutations or changes in the sequence of codons can lead to changes in the protein sequence, potentially altering its function or causing disease.\n\nThe study of codons and their interactions with regulatory elements such as promoters and enhancers is important in many fields of biology, particularly in understanding gene expression and genetic diseases."}, "What is an amino acid?": {"time": 30.186376333236694, "answer": "RATE LIMIT"}, "What is a BLAST search?": {"time": 5.640152931213379, "answer": "An amino acid is an organic compound that is a building block of proteins.

The branching pattern of the tree illustrates the relationships of the organisms to each other, with closely related organisms depicted as closely-branching twigs and more distantly related organisms on separate branches.\n\nPhylogenetic trees have many applications in biology, including in understanding evolutionary history, classifying organisms, predicting protein structure and function, and studying the distribution of genetic traits across populations. They are widely used in fields such as genomics, ecology, and microbiology.\n\nGene Ontology (GO) is a standardized vocabulary and framework for describing gene and protein functions across all organisms. GO provides a common language for researchers to describe the biological roles of genes and their products in a rigorous and structured way.\n\nGO terms are defined by the Gene Ontology Consortium, a collaborative effort of researchers from around the world. The terms are organized into a hierarchical structure that includes three domains: Molecular Function, Biological Process, and Cellular Component. Each term represents a biological concept, such as \"kinase activity\" or \"cell differentiation\", and can be used to annotate genes and their products in databases.\n\nGO annotations are used by researchers to interpret experimental results, characterize gene function, and identify related genes that are involved in similar biological processes.
