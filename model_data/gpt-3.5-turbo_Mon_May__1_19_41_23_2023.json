It states that DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is transcribed into RNA (ribonucleic acid), which is then translated into proteins. This process of DNA \u2192 RNA \u2192 protein is unidirectional and fundamental to life processes.\n\nThe central dogma describes the two main processes by which genetic information is expressed. During transcription, the DNA sequence is transcribed into RNA, which carries the genetic information in a messenger form. Then, the RNA sequence is translated to synthesize proteins, which are responsible for many cellular functions.\n\nHowever, recent advances in the field of molecular biology, such as the discovery of reverse transcription and RNA editing, have challenged some aspects of the central dogma. Nonetheless, the central dogma still provides the basic framework for understanding how genetic information is converted into functional proteins in living cells."}, "What is a genome?": {"time": 4.956936597824097, "answer": "A genome is the complete set of genetic material, including DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and/or RNA (ribonucleic acid), of an organism or a virus. The genome contains all of the information required for an organism to develop, function, and reproduce. It provides the blueprint for the production of all the proteins and molecules that make up an organism.\n\nThe size and complexity of genomes vary widely among different species. For example, the genome of a virus may only consist of a few genes, while the human genome contains over 20,000 genes. Some organisms, such as bacteria, have small and compact genomes, while others, such as plants, have large and complex genomes.\n\nThe study of genomes, called genomics, has become increasingly important in biology and medicine.

Genes are the basic units of heredity and provide the instructions for the development, growth, and function of all living organisms. Each gene is made up of a specific sequence of nucleotides, the building blocks of DNA, which determine the order of amino acids in a protein.\n\nThe function of a gene depends on the protein that it codes for. Proteins are essential molecules that carry out many functions in the cell, such as catalyzing chemical reactions, transporting molecules, and providing structural support. Genes, therefore, provide the blueprint for the production of proteins, which are essential for the structure and function of all living organisms.\n\nMutations or changes in the DNA sequence of a gene can alter the protein that it codes for, leading to changes in an organism's traits or characteristics.

The nitrogenous base can be adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) or thymine (T) in DNA or uracil (U) in RNA.\n\nThe nucleotides are joined together in a specific sequence, with the sugar and phosphate groups forming the backbone of the nucleic acid, and the nitrogenous bases attached to the sugars. The sequence of nucleotides in DNA or RNA determines the genetic information stored in the molecule.\n\nThe four nitrogenous bases in DNA, A, C, G and T, form complementary pairs: A always pairs with T and C always pairs with G. In RNA, uracil (U) replaces thymine (T) and A pairs with U.\n\nThe specific sequence of nucleotides in DNA and RNA is responsible for carrying genetic information from one generation to the next and directing the production of proteins which perform numerous functions in the cell."}, "What is a codon?": {"time": 5.65094518661499, "answer": "A codon is a sequence of three nucleotides (letters) in mRNA (messenger RNA) that codes for a specific amino acid during protein synthesis. There are 64 possible codons, which can encode the 20 different amino acids found in proteins, as well as signals for starting and stopping protein synthesis.\n\nThe process of converting the sequence of codons in mRNA into a chain of amino acids is called translation. During translation, tRNA (transfer RNA) molecules bring the corresponding amino acids to the ribosome based on the codon sequence in the mRNA.\n\nThe genetic code is the set of rules relating each codon to its corresponding amino acid. The genetic code is degenerate, meaning that some amino acids can be coded for by more than one codon. This redundancy allows for some protection against mutations that might otherwise lead to changes in the protein sequence.\n\nThe discovery of the genetic code and the relationship between codons and amino acids was a major breakthrough in understanding how genetic information is expressed and has been essential to advances in the field of molecular biology."}, "What is an amino acid?": {"time": 30.243224382400513, "answer": "RATE LIMIT"}, "What is a BLAST search?": {"time": 5.44672417640686, "answer": "A BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) search is a computational method widely used to compare a DNA or protein sequence to a database of known sequences. The goal of a BLAST search is to identify similar sequences in the database, which can provide information about the function, structure, and evolutionary history of the query sequence.\n\nBLAST works by searching a database of known sequences for regions with high similarity to the query sequence, called local alignments. The algorithm identifies segments of the query sequence that are most similar to regions in the database sequences, based on a scoring system that takes into account the number and position of mismatches, gaps, and similarities. The result of the search is a list of the database sequences that show the highest level of homology to the query sequence, ranked by their similarity scores.\n\nBLAST searches are used in a wide range of applications, including gene and genome annotation, sequence alignment, phylogenetic analysis, and functional classification of proteins.

The aligned sequences can then be compared to determine important functional regions or conserved domains.\n\nMSAs have several applications, such as identifying protein families, detecting functionally important residues in proteins, and identifying sites of conserved non-coding DNA. The results of a multiple sequence alignment can also reveal patterns of evolution and genetic variation across species.\n\nMSAs can be performed using various software tools, some of which are available freely online.

Haplotypes can be inherited from either parent, as each parent passes down one of their two haplotypes for each chromosome. \n\nHaplotypes are important in genetics research because they can be used to study the inheritance patterns of genetic variants and evaluate their association with specific diseases or traits. Some genetic variants, including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), tend to be inherited together on a specific haplotype, a phenomenon known as linkage disequilibrium (LD). By studying haplotypes, researchers can identify regions of the genome that are associated with a disease or trait, even if the specific causal variant is not yet known. \n\nHaplotypes are also useful for studying evolutionary relationships among populations.
