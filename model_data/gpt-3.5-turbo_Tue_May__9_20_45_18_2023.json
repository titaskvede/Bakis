It states that DNA is transcribed into RNA, which is then translated into proteins. This principle is essentially a one-way street, where genetic information flows from DNA, to RNA and finally, to proteins.\n\nIn detail, DNA serves as the repository of genetic information in cells and is responsible for encoding all the instructions needed for organismal development and function. When information stored in the DNA is required to be acted upon, it is first transcribed onto RNA by an enzyme called RNA polymerase. RNA then acts as an intermediary molecule that carries the information to ribosomes, the cellular machinery that translates the RNA into proteins, the functional molecules that carry out most of the work in cells. This process is known as translation and involves the decoding of genetic information in the form of codons, a sequence of three nucleotides in the RNA molecule, into amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. Every living organism, from bacteria to humans, follows the central dogma principle."}, "What is a genome?": {"time": 4.425496339797974, "answer": "A genome is the complete set of genetic material, including the entire set of genes and other non-coding DNA, in an organism. It contains all the hereditary information that an organism inherits from its parents. \n\nThe genome of a particular organism is usually encoded in its DNA, a long chain-like molecule that carries information in the form of genes. The DNA sequence within a genome contains the instructions required for an organism's growth, development, and operation, providing the blueprint for the organism's structure and function. \n\nGenomes can vary significantly between different species, and even within individuals of the same species. Genome sequencing, or determining the DNA sequence of an organism's genome, has become a powerful tool in modern biology, enabling researchers to study the genetic basis of traits and diseases, compare the genomes of different organisms, and trace the evolutionary history of species."}, "What is a protein?": {"time": 30.184300422668457, "answer": "RATE LIMIT"}, "What is a gene?": {"time": 6.514503479003906, "answer": "A gene is a segment of DNA that acts as a unit of inheritance and carries information for creating a particular functional product, such as a protein or RNA molecule. Genes typically consist of instructions for the sequence of amino acids that make up a protein, though some genes encode RNA molecules that perform other functions in the cell. Genes are found on chromosomes and are passed down from parents to offspring during reproduction.\n\nThe expression of genes, or the process by which the genetic code within a gene is used to create a functional product, is essential to all biological processes. Gene expression begins with the conversion of DNA to RNA through a process called transcription, where an enzyme called RNA polymerase reads the DNA sequence and makes a complementary RNA molecule. Depending on the type of gene, the RNA molecule may then undergo additional processing to form a mature functional product, such as a protein, or it may serve as a functional molecule itself.\n\nDifferent combinations and interactions of genes and their products contribute to the diversity of physical and biochemical traits observed in organisms, including susceptibility to certain diseases, physical characteristics, and behavior. Changes to the DNA sequence of a gene, or mutations, can alter the function of the gene product, leading to genetic disorders or adaptations to environmental changes over time."}, "What is DNA sequencing?": {"time": 5.782245874404907, "answer": "DNA sequencing is the process of determining the sequence of nucleotides in a DNA molecule. This process can reveal the genetic information stored in DNA and provide insights into the genetic makeup of an organism. \n\nThe process of DNA sequencing can be done using various methods, but most modern sequencing technologies are based on the principle of DNA amplification and detection. This involves breaking down the DNA molecule into smaller fragments, amplifying them using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and then sequencing the fragments using high-throughput sequencing technologies such as next-generation sequencing (NGS).\n\nThe output of a DNA sequencing experiment is a large collection of DNA sequences, or reads, which need to be assembled into longer contiguous sequences, or contigs. This process is called genome assembly, and it involves using computational algorithms and bioinformatics tools to piece together the short reads into longer sequences that represent the original DNA molecule.\n\nDNA sequencing is a powerful tool in a wide range of scientific fields, including genetics, evolutionary biology, medicine, and biotechnology. DNA sequencing has been instrumental in decoding the human genome, studying the genetic basis of diseases, identifying pathogens, tracking the spread of infectious diseases, and engineering new organisms with specific traits."}, "What is the difference between DNA and RNA?": {"time": 30.22198224067688, "answer": "RATE LIMIT"}, "What is a nucleotide?": {"time": 7.652627468109131, "answer": "DNA (Deoxyribonucleic acid) and RNA (Ribonucleic acid) are both nucleic acids that carry genetic information in cells. The primary difference between DNA and RNA is the type of sugar they contain, as well as their structure and function. DNA contains the sugar deoxyribose, while RNA contains the sugar ribose. The other main differences between DNA and RNA are:\n\n- DNA is typically double-stranded, while RNA is usually single-stranded.\n- DNA contains the bases adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine, while RNA contains uracil instead of thymine.\n- DNA is responsible for storing genetic information, while RNA is primarily involved in transcription and translation, the processes by which DNA is transcribed into RNA and RNA is translated into proteins.\n\nA nucleotide is the basic building block of nucleic acids such as DNA and RNA. It is composed of a sugar molecule (either ribose or deoxyribose in DNA), a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base. The nitrogenous base can be adenine, guanine, cytosine, thymine (in DNA only), or uracil (in RNA only).\n\nThe sequence of nucleotides in a DNA or RNA molecule determines the genetic information it carries.

Each codon corresponds to a specific amino acid or a signal to start or stop translation.\n\nThe genetic code is a set of rules that dictates how codons in DNA and RNA translate to amino acids in proteins. There are 64 possible codons, but only 20 amino acids, so most amino acids are specified by multiple codons. Some amino acids are specified by as many as six different codons, while others are specified by only one. \n\nThe order and arrangement of codons within a gene determine the order of amino acids in a protein, which in turn determines the protein's structure and function. Mutations or changes in the sequence of codons within a gene can alter the resulting protein, which can affect the function of the protein and the phenotype of an organism.\n\nThe genetic code is universal among living organisms, with slight variations observed in certain organisms or organelles.
