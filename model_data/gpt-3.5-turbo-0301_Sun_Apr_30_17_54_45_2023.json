The order of codons determines the sequence of amino acids in a protein. There are a total of 64 possible codons, which encode 20 different amino acids and three stop signals (UAA, UAG, and UGA). \n\nDuring protein synthesis, ribosomes read the sequence of codons in a messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule and assemble the corresponding sequence of amino acids to form a protein. Each codon in the mRNA molecule is recognized by a corresponding transfer RNA (tRNA) molecule, which carries a specific amino acid that corresponds to the codon. The tRNA molecule recognizes the codon through its anticodon, a three-nucleotide sequence complementary to the codon sequence.\n\nThe genetic code, which describes the relationship between codons and amino acids, is nearly universal among all living organisms, meaning that the same codon usually codes for the same amino acid in all species.
