It states that genetic information flows from DNA to RNA to protein.\n\nIn simpler terms, the central dogma describes the process by which the genetic code stored in an organism's DNA is first transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA), and then translated into a chain of amino acids that form a protein. The DNA sequence provides the template for mRNA synthesis, and the mRNA sequence is subsequently translated into the amino acid sequence of a protein.\n\nThe central dogma has important implications for biological research, as it allows scientists to understand how genetic information is encoded and expressed in living organisms, and to design experiments to manipulate and study the genetic code."}, "What is a genome?": {"time": 4.572706460952759, "answer": "A genome is the complete set of genetic material or DNA of an organism, including all of its genes and non-coding sequences. It contains all of the information needed to build and maintain an organism, from its very early stages of development through to its full grown form. \n\nA genome can be found in different parts of the organism, depending on its complexity. In simpler organisms like bacteria, the genome is typically contained in a single circular chromosome. More complex organisms have larger genomes, which may be divided into multiple chromosomes. \n\nThe study of genomes is an important area of biology, as it can reveal the genetic basis for an organism's characteristics and provide insight into its evolutionary history.

It serves as the basic unit of heredity, or the mechanism by which traits are passed from one generation to the next.\n\nEach gene contains the instructions for making a single protein or a functional RNA molecule. Proteins are the building blocks of life and perform a variety of functions within an organism, from enzymes that catalyze chemical reactions to structural proteins that form the physical structures of cells and tissues.\n\nThe information encoded in a gene is carried on the DNA molecule as a sequence of nucleotide bases (A, C, G, and T), with each sequence encoding a specific amino acid building block for the protein. The process of gene expression involves the transcription of the DNA sequence into messenger RNA (mRNA), which is then translated into an amino acid sequence to form the protein.\n\nThe study of genes and their functions, including how they are regulated and interact with each other, is an important area of research in biology and genetics."}, "What is DNA sequencing?": {"time": 4.618694543838501, "answer": "DNA sequencing is the process of determining the precise order or sequence of nucleotide bases (A, C, G, and T) in a DNA molecule.

DNA contains a sugar called deoxyribose, while RNA contains a sugar called ribose. In DNA, the base uracil is replaced by thymine in RNA.\n\nAnother key difference between DNA and RNA is their functions. DNA contains the genetic instructions for the development, function, and reproduction of all living organisms, while RNA is involved in various biological processes, including protein synthesis, mRNA regulation, and gene expression.\n\nA nucleotide is the basic building block of nucleic acids, such as DNA and RNA. It consists of three parts: a sugar molecule (either deoxyribose or ribose), a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base. The nitrogenous base can be one of four types: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), or thymine (T) in DNA, and uracil (U) in RNA.\n\nThe specific sequence of nucleotides in a DNA or RNA molecule determines the genetic information it carries and the function it performs within the cell."}, "What is a codon?": {"time": 5.4238598346710205, "answer": "A codon is a sequence of three nucleotides (A, C, G, or U) in mRNA that specifies a particular amino acid building block during protein synthesis.

The codon AUG serves as the start codon, which signals the beginning of protein synthesis, while the codons UAA, UAG, and UGA serve as stop codons, which signal the end of protein synthesis.\n\nDuring translation, the mRNA sequence containing the codons is read by ribosomes, which assemble the appropriate amino acids in the correct order to form a protein. The sequence of codons in a gene determines the order and type of amino acids that make up the protein, and therefore the protein's structure and function."}, "What is an amino acid?": {"time": 30.201782703399658, "answer": "RATE LIMIT"}, "What is a BLAST search?": {"time": 6.307525634765625, "answer": "An amino acid is a type of biological molecule that serves as the building block for proteins, which are essential to life processes in all living organisms.

Each amino acid is joined to the next by a peptide bond, creating a chain of amino acids known as a polypeptide. The order and sequence of amino acids in a protein determine its shape and function.\n\nA BLAST search is a powerful tool used in bioinformatics to find similarities between a query sequence (DNA or protein) and a sequence database. BLAST stands for Basic Local Alignment Search Tool. It works by comparing the query sequence against a database of sequences, looking for regions of similarity or matching patterns, and then scoring and ranking the matches based on statistical significance.\n\nBy identifying similarities between sequences, a BLAST search can help to determine the function and evolutionary history of a particular sequence.

They can also be used to study the rate and direction of evolutionary change, to infer ancestral traits and characteristics, and to predict the functional properties of genes and proteins.\n\nGene ontology (GO) is a standardized system of functional classification and annotation for genes and proteins. It involves the categorization of genes and proteins into functional groups based on their shared biological functions and properties.\n\nThe GO system uses a controlled vocabulary of terms to describe genes and proteins based on three main categories: molecular function (the specific biochemical activity of a protein), cellular component (the parts of a cell or tissue where a protein is found), and biological process (the biological pathways or activities that a protein is involved in).\n\nBy assigning genes and proteins to functional categories, GO can help researchers to understand the roles and relationships of different genes and proteins within a biological system.
