It states that DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) contains the genetic information that directs the synthesis of RNA (ribonucleic acid) which in turn directs the synthesis of proteins. \n\nThis process occurs in a sequence of three steps: \n\n1. DNA replication: DNA is replicated when a cell divides to form two daughter cells. Each daughter cell receives a complete copy of the parent cell's DNA.\n\n2. Transcription: The information stored in DNA is transcribed into RNA through a process called transcription. This process involves the synthesis of RNA molecules based on the sequence of nucleotides in the DNA molecule.\n\n3. Translation: The information stored in RNA is translated into proteins through a process called translation. This process involves the synthesis of proteins based on the sequence of nucleotides in the RNA molecule. \n\nOverall, the central dogma of molecular biology explains the flow of genetic information from DNA to RNA to protein within a biological system."}, "What is a genome?": {"time": 2.99269962310791, "answer": "A genome is an organism's complete set of genetic instructions, including all of its genes and genetic material.

The genetic code is the set of rules that specifies the correspondence between codons and the amino acids that they encode. There are 64 possible codons (4^3) in the genetic code, but only 20 amino acids and 3 stop signals. This means that multiple codons can code for the same amino acid, and certain codons may have different functions in different contexts.\n\nDuring protein synthesis, transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules deliver amino acids to ribosomes, where the codons on messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules specify the order in which the amino acids should be assembled to form a protein. The ribosome reads the codons on the mRNA in order, with each codon specifying a different amino acid.

The length of the branches is proportional to the amount of evolutionary change that has occurred along that branch, with longer branches indicating more evolutionary change. The topology, or branching pattern, of the tree represents the inferred evolutionary relationships among the organisms or sequences being studied.\n\nPhylogenetic trees are based on various types of data, including morphological traits, biochemical molecules such as DNA and protein sequences, and behavioral characteristics. Molecular data is particularly useful for constructing phylogenetic trees because it provides a direct measure of the genetic similarities and differences among organisms or sequences.\n\nOverall, phylogenetic trees are an important tool in evolutionary biology, systematics, and comparative genomics.
