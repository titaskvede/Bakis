The dogma consists of three main steps:\n\n1. DNA replication: The process by which DNA makes an exact copy of itself before cell division.\n\n2. Transcription: The process by which the information encoded in DNA is used to produce a messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule. This involves the transcription enzyme RNA polymerase, which reads the sequence of DNA nucleotides and generates a complementary RNA strand.\n\n3. Translation: The process by which the information encoded in mRNA is used to synthesize a protein. This involves the ribosome, an organelle composed of RNA and proteins, which reads the sequence of mRNA codons and links amino acids together to form a protein.\n\nOverall, the central dogma states that DNA is transcribed into RNA, and RNA is translated into proteins, which serve as the functional units of cells. This process is unidirectional, and genetic information cannot flow from proteins back to RNA or DNA."}, "What is a genome?": {"time": 4.608013391494751, "answer": "A genome is the entire set of genetic material or DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) that an organism possesses. The genome contains all the information necessary to build and maintain an organism, including instructions for the synthesis of proteins and other molecules that carry out various biological functions.\n\nGenomes can vary significantly in size and complexity among different organisms. For example, the genome of a bacterium consists of a single, circular DNA molecule with tens of thousands of base pairs, while the genome of a human contains 23 pairs of linear chromosomes, with approximately 3 billion base pairs.\n\nAdvances in DNA sequencing technology have enabled scientists to study and compare the genomes of different organisms, providing insights into their evolutionary history, functional and structural differences, and potential applications in various fields, such as medicine and biotechnology."}, "What is a protein?": {"time": 30.193297386169434, "answer": "RATE LIMIT"}, "What is a gene?": {"time": 6.145460844039917, "answer": "A gene is a segment of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) that contains the instructions for making a specific protein or a functional RNA molecule. The DNA sequence of a gene determines the order of amino acids in a protein or the shape and function of the RNA molecule.\n\nThe process by which the information in a gene is used to make a protein is called gene expression and involves two main steps: transcription and translation. In transcription, an RNA molecule called messenger RNA (mRNA) is produced from the DNA template by RNA polymerase enzyme. In translation, the mRNA molecule is used as a template to synthesize a specific sequence of amino acids, which are then linked together to form a protein by a complex of ribosomes.\n\nGenes carry out a wide range of functions in cells, including the regulation of biochemical pathways, the control of cellular development and division, and the response to internal or external signals.

While DNA exists as a double-stranded helix in most organisms, RNA molecules are usually single-stranded.\n\nThe main differences between DNA and RNA are:\n\n1. Sugar: DNA has a deoxyribose sugar, while RNA has a ribose sugar.\n\n2. Bases: DNA contains the bases adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T), while RNA contains A, C, G, and uracil (U). \n\n3. Function: DNA carries the genetic information that is passed from parents to offspring, while RNA acts as a messenger between DNA and ribosomes, where proteins are synthesized. There are also different types of RNA, such as tRNA, rRNA, and snRNA, which have their own specific roles in the process of gene expression.\n\nA nucleotide is the basic structural unit of nucleic acids, including DNA and RNA.

The genetic code is the set of rules by which the sequence of nucleotides within codons is translated into a protein sequence.\n\nSince there are 64 possible combinations of three nucleotides, but only 20 amino acids, multiple codons can code for the same amino acid, with the exception of the three stop codons that signal the end of protein synthesis.\n\nThe codons determine the sequence of amino acids in a protein, which in turn, determines its folding, structure and function within the cell. The codon-structure of DNA also plays a significant role in genetics, as mutations in the sequence of nucleotides within a gene can lead to altered protein sequences and genetic disorders."}, "What is an amino acid?": {"time": 4.694143295288086, "answer": "An amino acid is a fundamental building block of proteins, which are the functional units of cells.

The process involves identifying homologous regions in various sequences, assigning gaps within these regions, and arranging sequences to optimize for maximal conservation of homologous characters.\n\nMSA can be performed using various methods such as the ClustalW, MUSCLE, and T-COFFEE algorithms. These programs use various techniques to calculate a score of alignment quality, such as sum-of-pairs score and structural alignment. They can also modify the scoring dynamically as the sequences become more similar or diverse.\n\nThe resulting alignment reveals conserved regions of a sequence, which can help identify biologically-important motifs, regulatory regions, and functionally-relevant domains.
