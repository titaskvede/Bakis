It summarizes the two-step process by which the information in DNA is converted into proteins, which are responsible for most of the functions in living cells.\n\nThe central dogma states that DNA is transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA), which is then translated into proteins. The process of transcription involves the synthesis of an mRNA copy of the DNA sequence in a gene. This mRNA copy carries the genetic information from the DNA to the ribosome, the cellular machinery responsible for protein synthesis.\n\nAt the ribosome, the mRNA is translated into a specific sequence of amino acids, which are then joined together to form a protein. The sequence of amino acids in a protein is determined by the genetic code, which specifies the relationship between each triplet of nucleotides in the mRNA (called a codon) and the corresponding amino acid.\n\nThe central dogma is often referred to as an \"unidirectional\" flow of information, as the flow of information from DNA to proteins is not reversible under normal biological conditions. However, recent discoveries in the field of epigenetics have challenged this concept by showing how environmental factors can influence gene expression, DNA repair, and other aspects of genetic regulation."}, "What is a genome?": {"time": 30.18960928916931, "answer": "RATE LIMIT: Rate limit reached for default-gpt-3.5-turbo in organization org-ewHIDGc2eR9Cbqjz5VT9WZqt on requests per min.

While both DNA and RNA are made up of the same building blocks called nucleotides (adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine), they have some fundamental differences:\n\n1. Structure: DNA is a double-stranded helix, while RNA is typically a single-stranded molecule. The DNA molecule consists of two long strands of nucleotides twisted together into a spiral shape, forming a double helix. RNA, on the other hand, is usually a single-stranded molecule with a more diverse range of shapes.\n\n2. Sugar: The sugar in DNA is deoxyribose, which is a type of sugar with one less oxygen atom than ribose, the sugar in RNA.\n\n3. Bases: DNA uses the bases adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine, while RNA uses uracil instead of thymine.\n\n4. Function: DNA contains the genetic information that is passed down from one generation to the next and is used for the storage, replication, and transmission of genetic information. RNA is involved in the process of transcription, which converts the genetic information in DNA into a type of RNA called messenger RNA (mRNA). This mRNA is then used as a template for the synthesis of proteins through a process called translation.\n\n5. Stability: DNA is much more stable than RNA. This is because the presence of the extra oxygen atom in RNA makes its sugar molecule more chemically reactive, and RNA molecules tend to break down more easily than DNA molecules.\n\nOverall, DNA and RNA are similar in many ways, but they differ significantly in their structures, functions, and stability, reflecting their different roles in the cell."}, "What is a nucleotide?": {"time": 10.900210618972778, "answer": "A nucleotide is a molecule that serves as the building block of nucleic acids, such as DNA and RNA. A nucleotide is composed of three parts: a nitrogenous base, a sugar molecule, and a phosphate group.\n\nThe nitrogenous base is the part of the nucleotide that determines the identity of the nucleotide. There are four different nitrogenous bases found in DNA: Adenine (A), Thymine (T), Cytosine (C), and Guanine (G). In RNA, the base Thymine (T) is replaced by a similar base called Uracil (U).\n\nThe sugar molecule in DNA is deoxyribose, while in RNA it is ribose. The sugar is connected to the nitrogenous base at one end and the phosphate group at the other end.\n\nThe phosphate group is a molecule made up of a phosphorous atom bonded to four oxygen atoms. It is attached to the sugar molecule, forming a chain of sugar-phosphate backbone. This backbone provides structural support for the DNA and RNA molecules.\n\nThe sequence of nucleotides along the DNA or RNA chain carries genetic information, which is determined by the order of the nitrogenous bases. The way in which the nucleotides are arranged helps the cell to synthesize RNA and proteins, which are essential for the functioning of the cell. Nucleotides are therefore the fundamental building blocks of genetic material, and they have a wide range of biological roles in addition to their roles in DNA and RNA."}, "What is a codon?": {"time": 8.910747528076172, "answer": "A codon is a sequence of three nucleotides in DNA or RNA that codes for a specific amino acid or a stop signal during protein synthesis. There are 64 different codons, but only 20 different amino acids are used to build proteins, so multiple codons can code for the same amino acid, providing redundancy to the genetic code.\n\nEach codon is read by the ribosome during protein synthesis, which \"translates\" the sequence of nucleotides into a sequence of amino acids that form the protein. The genetic code specifies the relationship between each codon and its corresponding amino acid, as well as signals to the ribosome when to start and stop protein synthesis.\n\nFor example, the codon AUG codes for the amino acid methionine and also serves as the start codon, which signals the ribosome to begin translating the mRNA sequence into a protein. Another important codon is the stop codon, which signals the end of the protein sequence and the termination of translation.\n\nThe way in which the codons are arranged along an mRNA molecule determines the sequence of amino acids in the protein that is being synthesized. The order and composition of amino acids is critical to protein structure and function, making codons a key element of genetic information and gene expression."}, "What is an amino acid?": {"time": 9.722269773483276, "answer": "An amino acid is a type of organic molecule that serves as a building block for proteins. A protein is composed of one or more chains of amino acids linked together by peptide bonds, forming a long chain called a polypeptide.\n\nThere are 20 different amino acids that are commonly used to build proteins, each with its unique chemical properties and side chains. Amino acids are essential to life as they are the basis of all proteins that perform critical functions in living organisms, including enzymatic catalysis, cell signaling, and structural support.\n\nThe structure of an amino acid includes a central carbon atom, known as the alpha carbon, that is attached to four different chemical groups: an amino group, a carboxyl group, a hydrogen atom, and an R group (also called a side chain). The R group varies depending on the type of amino acid and gives each amino acid its specific chemical and physical properties.\n\nAmino acids can be obtained through the diet or synthesized by the body through a process known as biosynthesis. However, some amino acids are considered to be essential amino acids, as they cannot be produced by the body and must be obtained through the diet.\n\nOverall, amino acids are a critical component of living organisms and are used to build many different types of proteins that play important roles in maintaining cellular function and health."}, "What is a BLAST search?": {"time": 30.198654413223267, "answer": "RATE LIMIT: Rate limit reached for default-gpt-3.5-turbo in organization org-ewHIDGc2eR9Cbqjz5VT9WZqt on requests per min.

It is a fundamental technique in many fields of biological research, such as molecular evolution, phylogenetics, structural biology, and drug discovery.\n\nMultiple sequence alignment involves the identification of homologous positions between the sequences, which are those that have a common ancestor. The aim is to place the sequences in parallel, with as many aligned positions as possible, as unaligned regions contain no information about homology.\n\nThere are several algorithms and programs available to perform multiple sequence alignment, such as ClustalW, MUSCLE, and T-Coffee. These tools use different approaches to identify the conserved regions and generate the alignment. Some of the approaches include: progressive alignment (ClustalW and T-Coffee), iterative refinement (MUSCLE), and hidden Markov models (HMMs).\n\nThe generated alignment can then be used for structural and functional analysis, such as identifying conserved or variable regions, estimating evolutionary relationships, or predicting functional sites in proteins.\n\nMultiple sequence alignment is especially useful for studying gene and protein families, and for understanding the molecular basis of disease.
