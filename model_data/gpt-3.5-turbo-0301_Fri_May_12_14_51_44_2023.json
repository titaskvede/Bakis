Structure: DNA is a double-stranded helix composed of nucleotides containing the nitrogenous bases Adenine (A), Thymine (T), Guanine (G) and Cytosine (C), which are connected by hydrogen bonds. RNA, on the other hand, is typically single-stranded and contains the nitrogenous base Uracil (U) instead of Thymine. \n\n2. Function: DNA stores genetic information and serves as a template for the synthesis of RNA. RNA, in turn, is involved in the decoding of that genetic information into proteins, as well as in other cellular processes such as gene expression regulation. \n\n3. Stability: DNA is generally more stable than RNA due to the presence of thymine and its double-stranded structure which protects it from degradation by enzymes or physical and chemical factors. RNA is more prone to damage and degradation as it is usually single-stranded and exposed to more potential environmental threats.\n\n4. Location: DNA is typically found in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, whereas RNA can be found in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, and in some cases in extracellular fluids and relatively stable in contrast to RNA that can be transient and degraded in minutes.\n\nIn summary, DNA primarily functions as a storage molecule for genetic information, while RNA plays a more versatile role in gene expression and regulatory processes within the cell."}, "What is a nucleotide?": {"time": 8.615991353988647, "answer": "A nucleotide is a building block of nucleic acids such as DNA and RNA. It consists of three main components: a nitrogenous base, a pentose sugar, and a phosphate group.\n\nThe nitrogenous base is a carbon-nitrogen ring structure that can either be purine or pyrimidine in nature. The purine bases are Adenine (A) and Guanine (G) which have a double-ring structure. The pyrimidine bases are Cytosine (C), Thymine (T) (in DNA) or Uracil (U) (in RNA) which have a single ring structure.\n\nThe pentose sugar component is a 5-carbon sugar that is either deoxyribose in DNA or ribose in RNA. The difference between these two sugars is the presence or absence of an oxygen molecule attached to the carbon atom in the 2' position.\n\nThe phosphate group is a molecule made up of phosphorus and oxygen that is attached to the 5\u2019 carbon of the sugar component.\n\nNucleotides are joined together through covalent bonds between the phosphate group of one nucleotide and the 3\u2019 position of the sugar of another nucleotide to form a linear chain called a nucleic acid.

There are 20 amino acids commonly found in proteins, and multiple codons can code for the same amino acid. The genetic code is redundant in that some amino acids can be coded for by more than one codon. For example, the amino acid leucine is encoded by six different codons: UUA, UUG, CUU, CUC, CUA, and CUG. \n\nIn addition to encoding amino acids, there are also codons that serve as \"start\" and \"stop\" signals for protein synthesis. The start codon is AUG and codes for the amino acid methionine. The stop codons, UAA, UAG, and UGA, signal the end of translation and do not code for any amino acid. \n\nThe sequence of codons in a gene determines the sequence of amino acids in the protein that it encodes, and therefore the structure and function of the protein. Mistakes or mutations in the codons can have significant impacts on the protein, potentially leading to altered or malfunctioning proteins, genetic disorders, and diseases."}, "What is a BLAST search?": {"time": 7.579136610031128, "answer": "BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) is a widely used bioinformatics tool used to match a sequence database with a query sequence for the purpose of identifying similar sequences.
