The central dogma states that DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) carries the genetic information that is passed down from parents to offspring. This genetic information is then transcribed into RNA (ribonucleic acid), which acts as a template for the translation of genetic information into proteins.\n\nThe central dogma can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. DNA is transcribed into RNA by an enzyme called RNA polymerase.\n2. RNA is then translated into proteins by ribosomes.\n3. Proteins are the functional molecules in cells that perform a variety of cellular functions, including structural support, enzymatic activity, and cell signaling.\n\nWhile this framework is generally true for most biological systems, there are some exceptions to the central dogma, such as the reverse transcription process used by retroviruses and some other types of RNA viruses."}, "What is a genome?": {"time": 4.362192630767822, "answer": "A genome is the complete set of genetic material (DNA or RNA) in an organism. Genomes contain all the genetic information required to build and maintain the organism, including its physical and functional properties. The term \"genome\" can refer to the entire genetic material of an organism, such as the human genome or the genome of a bacterium, virus, or plant. It can also refer to a subset of the genetic material, such as the exome, which includes only the protein-coding regions of the genome.

Genes are the basic units of hereditary information that are passed down from parents to offspring during the process of reproduction. The DNA sequence of a gene encodes the information needed to synthesize a specific protein or RNA molecule that performs a particular function within the cell or organism.\n\nWhile the primary function of a gene is to encode protein, genes can also have regulatory functions, controlling the expression of other genes or playing roles in development, differentiation, and other biological processes. In addition, genes can be regulated by a variety of internal and external factors, including other genes, hormones, environmental cues, and physical stimuli.\n\nThe study of genes is an important field in genetics and molecular biology, as it can help to uncover the molecular and genetic bases of various diseases and conditions, and aid in the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches."}, "What is DNA sequencing?": {"time": 5.74250340461731, "answer": "DNA sequencing is the process of determining the precise order of nucleotides, the building blocks of DNA, in a given DNA molecule. The DNA sequencing process begins with the isolation of the DNA molecule from a biological sample such as blood, tissue or saliva. The sample is then processed through various methods, including amplification and purification, to prepare it for sequencing.\n\nDNA sequencing can be carried out using various methods, including the classical Sanger sequencing, the pyrosequencing method, and the more recently developed next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, such as Illumina sequencing and nanopore sequencing. These methods use different technologies to read the DNA sequence, but most rely on the use of fluorescent or other markers that allow the sequence to be read by a computer.\n\nThe ability to sequence DNA has revolutionized many fields of biology, including genetics, forensics, and biotechnology.

A nucleotide is composed of three main components: a nitrogenous base, a sugar molecule, and a phosphate group. \n\nThe nitrogenous base can be adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), or guanine (G) in DNA, and uracil (U) in RNA. RNA contains uracil instead of thymine. The sugar molecule in DNA is deoxyribose, while the sugar molecule in RNA is ribose. \n\nThe phosphate group is attached to the 5' carbon of the sugar molecule, while the nitrogenous base is attached to the 1' carbon. The 3' carbon of the sugar molecule is involved in forming phosphodiester bonds with other nucleotides, which link the individual nucleotides together to form a DNA or RNA strand.\n\nThe sequence of nucleotides in DNA and RNA determines the genetic information that is encoded in these molecules.

Other codons signal the addition of specific amino acids to the growing protein chain, while others signal the end of the protein chain.\n\nThe genetic code is degenerate, which means that there is redundancy in the codon-amino acid correspondence. For example, multiple codons may code for the same amino acid, allowing for some variation in the DNA sequence without changing the resulting protein. \n\nThe discovery of the genetic code and the role of codons in protein synthesis was a major breakthrough in molecular biology, and it has allowed scientists to manipulate and engineer genes to produce desired proteins with specific sequences, structures, and functions."}, "What is an amino acid?": {"time": 30.194653511047363, "answer": "RATE LIMIT"}, "What is a BLAST search?": {"time": 8.387542247772217, "answer": "An amino acid is a small organic compound that contains a carboxyl group (-COOH), an amino group (-NH2), and a side chain that varies among different amino acids.

Gaps may be introduced in the alignment to account for insertions or deletions in the sequences. The goal of the MSA is to identify similarities in the sequences and to highlight conserved domains or motifs, which may be used to infer functional or structural relationships among the sequences.\n\nMSA is an important tool in many areas of bioinformatics, including gene and protein sequence analysis, functional prediction, and phylogenetic analysis.

Members of a protein family often have similar enzymatic, structural or regulatory functions, such as proteases, kinases, and ion channels. Examples of protein families include the globin family, which includes hemoglobin and myoglobin, and the kinase family, which includes enzymes involved in cell signaling.\n\nProtein families can be used as a powerful tool for predicting the function of newly identified proteins, as well as for aiding in structure-function studies of known proteins. Because members of a protein family have similar properties and functions, information about one protein in the family can often be applied to other members of the family.
