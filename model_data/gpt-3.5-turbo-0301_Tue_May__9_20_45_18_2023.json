Nucleotide bases are the building blocks of DNA. The technology used for DNA sequencing has advanced significantly in recent years, making it faster, more accurate, and less expensive. DNA sequencing is essential for many fields of research, such as genetics, genomics, and evolutionary biology.\n\nThere are different methods of DNA sequencing, but the most common method is based on the synthesis of a complementary strand of DNA. The DNA is first amplified to generate a large number of identical copies. These copies are mixed with nucleotides (dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP), DNA polymerase enzyme, and a primer sequence that is complementary to the beginning of the sequence to be determined. As the complementary strand is synthesized, special fluorescent dyes are released, which can be detected to determine the nucleotide that has been incorporated at each step.\n\nThe resulting data is a sequence of the nucleotide bases in the DNA molecule.

They are similar in many ways but also differ in important ways. \n\nHere are some key differences:\n\n1. Structure: DNA is double-stranded, while RNA is single-stranded. DNA consists of two complementary strands of nucleotides that wind around each other to form a double helix. RNA, on the other hand, typically exists as a single strand of nucleotides.\n\n2. Bases: DNA and RNA both contain four nucleotide bases: adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and uracil (U). However, DNA uses thymine (T) instead of uracil, which is found in RNA.\n\n3. Function: DNA is responsible for storing and transmitting genetic information from one generation to the next. RNA, however, is involved in the synthesis of proteins by carrying the genetic information from the DNA in the nucleus to ribosomes - the cellular machinery that makes proteins.\n\n4. Stability: DNA is more stable than RNA because it has a double-stranded structure and an extra stabilizing sugar called deoxyribose. RNA, being more reactive, is subject to decay more readily and has a shorter lifespan.\n\nOverall, while DNA is like a master blueprint and stores genetic information, RNA acts as a messenger, transcribing this information to make products like proteins."}, "What is a nucleotide?": {"time": 30.318593978881836, "answer": "RATE LIMIT"}, "What is a codon?": {"time": 5.424928426742554, "answer": "A codon is a sequence of three nucleotides (a triplet) that codes for a specific amino acid during protein synthesis.
