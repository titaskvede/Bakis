It states that DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is transcribed into RNA (ribonucleic acid), and RNA is then translated into proteins. This means that the instructions for making proteins, which are the building blocks of cells and play many critical roles in biological processes, are encoded in the DNA sequence. \n\nDNA replication occurs before cell division, and transcription of a portion of DNA is the first step in gene expression. RNA translation happens on ribosomes, which create specific proteins from the RNA sequence. Proteins are part of cells' structural and enzymatic components, transferring genetic information from one generation of cells to the next. The central dogma is a fundamental concept in molecular biology that explains how genetic information flows through cells and is essential for understanding DNA replication, gene expression, and the mechanisms of life."}, "What is a genome?": {"time": 6.730999708175659, "answer": "A genome is the complete set of genetic material, including all the genes and non-coding sequences, contained within the DNA of an individual organism, cell, or virus. It is the entirety of an organism's hereditary instructions, consisting of long chains of nucleotide sequences that encode the genetic information necessary for the development, growth, and function of every living organism.\n\nThe genome contains all the information necessary to produce RNA (ribonucleic acid) and proteins that perform essential functions within the organism. The study of genomes is called genomics, and it involves the sequencing, mapping, and analysis of DNA sequences of different organisms. \n\nGenomes vary in size and complexity depending on the organism.

DNA and RNA are both nucleic acids, and they share some similar characteristics, but there are some fundamental differences.\n\nThe main difference between DNA and RNA is their structure. DNA is usually in the form of a double helix structure composed of two complementary strands of nucleotides that run in opposite directions and are held together by hydrogen bonds between complementary base pairs (A-T and C-G). RNA is also composed of nucleotides, but it is typically made up of a single strand and does not form a double helix structure.\n\nThe difference in structure also leads to differences in function. DNA stores genetic information and provides the instructions for the development, growth, and function of all living organisms. The RNA carries out different tasks such as reading the genetic information provided by DNA, serving as a template for protein synthesis, or performing catalytic functions itself.\n\nAnother key difference between DNA and RNA is the type of nucleotides they contain. Both DNA and RNA are made up of four nucleotides, but DNA contains the nucleotide thymine, while RNA contains the nucleotide uracil. RNA molecules are typically much shorter than DNA, and are less stable.\n\nIn summary, while both DNA and RNA are involved in the storage, transmission, and expression of genetic information, they have different structures, functions, and nucleotide compositions."}, "What is a nucleotide?": {"time": 7.087520599365234, "answer": "A nucleotide is the basic building block of nucleic acids such as DNA and RNA. A nucleotide consists of three components: a sugar molecule, a nitrogenous base, and a phosphate group.\n\nThe sugar molecule in nucleotides is either deoxyribose in the case of DNA or ribose in the case of RNA. The nitrogenous base can be one of four types: adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), or thymine (T) in DNA or uracil (U) in RNA. The nitrogenous base is attached to the sugar molecule in the nucleotide, and the phosphate groups are attached to the sugar molecule to form the backbone of the nucleic acid.\n\nThe sequence of nucleotides in a DNA or RNA molecule determines the genetic code, which provides the instructions for the development, growth, and function of all living organisms. The order of the nitrogenous bases in DNA determines the specific amino acid sequence in proteins, while the order of nitrogenous bases in RNA acts as a template for protein synthesis.\n\nNucleotides also have a variety of other functions in cells, including serving as energy carriers and signal transducers within cells.

Each codon codes for a single amino acid, with the exception of three \"stop\" codons that signal the end of protein synthesis.\n\nThere are 64 possible codons that code for the 20 different amino acids found in proteins. Some amino acids are coded for by more than one codon. The genetic code, which is the set of rules by which information encoded in genetic material is translated into proteins, is based on the specific sequence of codons.\n\nThe sequence and order of codons in DNA and RNA determine the order of amino acids in the protein chain. Protein synthesis begins when a start codon, usually the sequence AUG (in RNA), is read by the ribosome. The ribosome then moves along the mRNA template, reading each codon and adding the corresponding amino acid to the growing protein chain. This process continues until a stop codon is reached, signaling the end of protein synthesis.\n\nThe study of codon usage and codon bias contributes to the understanding of gene regulation and expression, evolution, and the design of synthetic genes for biotechnological applications."}, "What is an amino acid?": {"time": 7.978546857833862, "answer": "An amino acid is an organic molecule that serves as the building block of proteins. Amino acids consist of an amine group (-NH2), a carboxyl group (-COOH), and a side chain group, specific to each amino acid, called the R-group. There are 20 different types of amino acids that are commonly found in proteins, each with a unique R-group.\n\nAmino acids are linked together by peptide bonds, which form between the carboxyl group of one amino acid and the amino group of another amino acid. The resulting chain of amino acids is referred to as a polypeptide chain. The sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide chain determines the three-dimensional structure of the protein, and hence its function.\n\nAmino acids are important in many biological processes. Besides being the building blocks of proteins, they also play roles in nutrient transport, gene expression, metabolism, and many other functions. Amino acid metabolism is essential in producing energy and regulating metabolic pathways. Many amino acids must be obtained from the diet since the human body cannot synthesize them.
