According to the central dogma, genetic information flows from DNA to RNA to protein. DNA serves as the template or blueprint for RNA, which then serves as the template for protein synthesis. This flow of information is unidirectional, with information transfer from DNA to RNA called transcription and transfer of information from RNA to protein called translation.\n\nIn summary, the central dogma can be stated as follows: DNA -transcription-> RNA -translation-> protein. The central dogma explains how genetic information stored in DNA is used to create proteins, which are the building blocks of all living organisms."}, "What is a genome?": {"time": 7.009417295455933, "answer": "A genome is the complete set of genetic material or DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) that encodes the genetic instructions for the development, growth, reproduction, and functioning of an organism.

Some side chains are hydrophobic and repel water, while others are hydrophilic and attract water. Some are positively or negatively charged, while others are neutral.\n\nAmino acids are linked together by peptide bonds, a process known as peptide bond formation, to form polypeptide chains. These polypeptide chains then fold into specific shapes to form functional proteins.
