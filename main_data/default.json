It states that DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), the genetic material that carries the instructions for the development and function of all living organisms, is transcribed into RNA (ribonucleic acid), and then translated into proteins. \n\nMore specifically, the central dogma consists of three main steps:\n1. Transcription: the process by which a segment of DNA is copied into RNA by an enzyme called RNA polymerase. \n2. RNA processing: the newly formed RNA molecule undergoes various modifications, including removal of introns (non-coding regions) and addition of a 5' cap and a 3' poly(A) tail. \n3. Translation: the processed RNA serves as a template for the assembly of proteins in the ribosome, where individual amino acids are added to a growing polypeptide chain according to the instructions specified by the RNA sequence. \n\nThe central dogma is a fundamental concept in molecular biology and a key principle that underlies many of the modern techniques used in bioinformatics."}, "What is a genome?": {"time": 13.643889427185059, "answer": "A genome is the complete set of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) or genetic material of an organism. It contains all the genetic instructions needed to develop, function and reproduce an organism. The size of a genome varies greatly between different organisms, with some bacteria having a few thousand base pairs of DNA and some plants and animals having billions of base pairs.\n\nThe term genome can also refer to the complete genetic information of a virus or organelle, such as mitochondria or chloroplasts. Typically, a genome is composed of one or more chromosomes, which are long strands of DNA containing many genes.\n\nGenomes can be sequenced, which involves determining the order of the individual nucleotide bases (adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine) that make up the DNA sequence. This allows researchers to study the genetic composition of an organism, including the identification of genes involved in specific biological processes or disorders. The availability of genome sequences has revolutionized many areas of biology and medicine, including drug discovery, medical diagnosis, and personalized medicine."}, "What is a protein?": {"time": 16.4932382106781, "answer": "A protein is a large, complex biomolecule that is essential to the functioning of a living organism. Proteins are made up of long chains of amino acids, which are linked together by peptide bonds. There are 20 different types of amino acids that can be used to build proteins, and the order in which they are arranged determines the unique structure and function of each protein.\n\nProteins are involved in a wide variety of biological processes, such as:\n- Enzymes: catalyzing chemical reactions\n- Structural proteins: providing support to cells and tissues \n- Transport proteins: carrying oxygen and other molecules around the body \n- Hormones: signaling between cells and tissues \n- Antibodies: defending against infections and diseases \n\nProteins can be produced from the genetic information contained in DNA through the process of transcription and translation. Different genes code for different proteins, and the proteins produced by cells in an organism dictate its traits and characteristics. \n\nScientists use a variety of methods to study proteins, including protein purification, X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and bioinformatics.

Genes are the basic units of heredity that determine an organism's traits, such as eye color, body size, or susceptibility to certain diseases.\n\nEach gene is located at a specific location on a chromosome, which is a long, linear structure made up of DNA and associated proteins. In humans, most genes are composed of multiple exons (coding regions) and introns (non-coding regions) that are transcribed into pre-mRNA, which is later spliced, polyadenylated, and processed into mature mRNA that exits the nucleus to be translated into protein in the cytoplasm.\n\nBecause of the central role of genes in protein synthesis and thus the functioning of living organisms, understanding how genes work and interact with each other is a major focus of molecular biology research.

However, they have several key differences:\n\n1. Structure: DNA is a double-stranded helix, while RNA is usually single-stranded. The sugar in DNA is deoxyribose, while the sugar in RNA is ribose. Also, DNA contains the nitrogenous base thymine, while RNA contains uracil instead.\n\n2. Location: DNA is located in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, while some types of RNA are found in the nucleus, but most are synthesized and function in the cytoplasm.\n\n3. Function: DNA contains the genetic information to make proteins through transcription and translation. RNA copies the DNA sequence and takes it to ribosomes where it serves as the template for constructing amino acids into proteins.\n\n4. Stability: DNA is relatively stable and can be damaged by radiation, chemicals, and other environmental factors. RNA, on the other hand, is much less stable and can be rapidly degraded by cellular enzymes if not needed anymore.\n\n5. Types: There are three types of RNA: messenger RNA (mRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA), and ribosomal RNA (rRNA). DNA has only one form.\n\nOverall, while DNA is the hereditary material responsible for storing and passing genetic information from one generation to the next, RNA is involved in the expression and regulation of genes through a wide range of different mechanisms."}, "What is a nucleotide?": {"time": 13.690979957580566, "answer": "A nucleotide is a molecule composed of a nitrogenous base, a five-carbon sugar (deoxyribose in DNA and ribose in RNA), and a phosphate group.

During protein synthesis, the genetic information encoded in DNA is transcribed into mRNA, which is then translated into protein at ribosomes using codons as the code for the order of amino acids.\n\nThere are 64 possible codons composed of the four nucleotide bases: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and uracil (U) in RNA, which are read in a specific order during protein synthesis. While 61 of the codons code for one of the 20 different amino acids, the other three (UAA, UAG, and UGA) are stop codons, signifying the end of the polypeptide chain.\n\nThe genetic code in codons is universal, which means that it is the same for all living organisms, from bacteria to humans. This allows for the exchange of genetic information and the use of recombinant DNA technology to modify gene sequences or express foreign genes in a wide range of organisms.\n\nThe discovery and characterization of the genetic code and codons have contributed to major advances in the fields of genetics and molecular biology, including the development of techniques such as DNA sequencing, genome engineering, and synthetic biology."}, "What is an amino acid?": {"time": 13.53881049156189, "answer": "An amino acid is a molecule that serves as the building block of proteins. Proteins are made up of chains of amino acids linked together by peptide bonds, and the sequence of amino acids determines the shape and function of the protein.\n\nThere are 20 different types of amino acids that can be used to build proteins. Each amino acid has a central carbon atom, called the alpha carbon, that is covalently bonded to an amino group (-NH2), a carboxyl group (-COOH), a hydrogen atom, and a variable side chain (R group) that gives each amino acid its unique properties.\n\nAmino acids are classified into two main categories: essential and non-essential amino acids. Essential amino acids are those that cannot be synthesized by the body and must be obtained from the diet, while non-essential amino acids can be synthesized by the body from other amino acids.\n\nIn addition to their role in protein synthesis, amino acids have numerous other functions in the body, including serving as precursors for the synthesis of other molecules such as neurotransmitters and nucleotides, energy sources, and regulators of metabolism and gene expression.\n\nOverall, amino acids play a critical role in many biological processes and are essential to the proper functioning of living organisms."}, "What is a BLAST search?": {"time": 14.910141706466675, "answer": "A BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) search is a bioinformatics tool used to find similarities between nucleotide or amino acid sequences in various databases.
